&emsp; DIB stands for Device Independent <a href="encoding">Bitmap</a>.

&emsp; A DIB contains a color table. A color table describes how pixel values correspond
&emsp; to RGB color values, which describe colors that are produced by emitting light.

&emsp; A DIB consists of two distinct parts: a BITMAPINFO structure describing the
&emsp; dimensions and colors of the bitmap, and an array of bytes defining the
&emsp; pixels of the bitmap. The bits in the array are packed together, but
&emsp; each scan line must be padded with zeros to end on a LONG data-type boundary.
&emsp; If the height of the bitmap is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-up DIB
&emsp; and its origin is the lower-left corner.
&emsp; If the height is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB
&emsp; and its origin is the upper left corner.
&emsp; It is used in such a way, as in:
&emsp; CreateDIBSection which creates a DIB that applications can write to directly.
&emsp; The function gives you a pointer to the location of the bitmap bit values.
&emsp; It requires parameters such as: a handle, a pointer to a BITMAPINFO,
&emsp; its RGB use case, the [out] ppvBits(pointer to a variable that receives
&emsp; a pointer to the location of the DIB bit values), and etc, etc. And that
&emsp; is that for a bitmap and its utilization.
