&emsp; : What does Math represent in programming?

&emsp;&emsp; To me, Math makes me think of buying Jello <a href="types">Pudding</a> for myself...
&emsp;&emsp; I bring it home, then I unpack the Jello construction kit, or whatever it is.
&emsp;&emsp; I follow the simple rules on the box, and presto Jello.
&emsp;&emsp; I might even divide parts of the Jello into little cubicles,
&emsp;&emsp; in preparation for a fellow person to experience the Jello-tasting with me.
&emsp;&emsp; I add complicated flavors together, tropical might be the right term.
&emsp;&emsp; So in this way, it is alot like the rules of a program, as well as the
&emsp;&emsp; tropical ingredients found within.
&emsp;&emsp; You can essentially go wild with whatever inside of a program.
&emsp;&emsp; Just take note of the rules that govern such a process.
&emsp;&emsp; The return type or resolution will give us some type of value.

&emsp;&emsp; Math in bitwise operations would represent the position of a
&emsp;&emsp; 1 or 0 in binary number associated with the given integer.

&emsp;&emsp; Math in regular operations... Well, just look at the examples.



&emsp;      /* Example 1 */



&emsp; int main()
&emsp; {
&emsp;     int b = 0;
    
&emsp;     while(b <= 5)
&emsp;     {
&emsp;         b = b + 2;
        
&emsp;         cout << "b is " << b << endl;
&emsp;     }
&emsp;     return 0;
&emsp; }


&emsp; The console comes out as:

&emsp; b is 2
&emsp; b is 4
&emsp; b is 6

&emsp; Anything in the body is iterated upon, such would a Forloop(;;)
&emsp; There are "3" times that b is less than or equal to 5...
&emsp; The first time is when b started at 0... Then, it added 2 to itself.
&emsp; The second time is when b started at 2... Then, it added 2 to itself.
&emsp; The third time is when b started at 4... Then, it added 2 to itself.

&emsp; It doesnt matter what the result goes by, it matters what b 'went' by, or 'while' b went by.

&emsp; Where a line of code is in a program matters. Play around. It will modify the codes behavior.

&emsp; Move "cout << ..." one line down, between the last two brackets.
&emsp; Now the priority of cout is diminished. We are only exposed to when "b started at 4, then added 2 to itself".



&emsp;      /* Example 2 */ <em>[This is a really great example to play with]</em>



&emsp; int factor(int F); // decl

&emsp; int main() {
  &emsp; int F, ans;
  &emsp; ans = factor(3);
  &emsp; cout << "Answer is: " << ans << " and ";
  &emsp; cout << "Answer is: " << F ;
  &emsp; }
	
&emsp; int factor(int F) { // maps integer to another integer
  &emsp; int ans = 3;
  &emsp; for(int i = 2; i <= F; i++)	{
  &emsp;   ans = i * 2;
  &emsp;   cout << "Answer is: " << ans << endl;
  &emsp;   cout << "Answer is: " << F << endl;
  &emsp; }
  
  &emsp; return ans;
&emsp; }


&emsp; The cout operations printed out of main are shown last.
&emsp; 'i' is less than 2 two times, so it does the other cout operations
&emsp;  two times. Anytime 'i' is less than 2... ans equals i * 2.
