<title>build path</title>

There's alot of experimenting we've been doing, and there's alot of different directions you could spend a large amount of time researching and playing with. One last thing I wanted to look into, a last piece of info, was how the entire build process of windows builds out, and/or what the compiler interacts with; by that i mean the layers of build-programming for the operating system, artifacts of the hardware, translate/definition layers preceding the compilers instructions, stuff like that, somewhere in msvc i presume. I guess its something youd have to study the actual files of, which i did, invoking msvc build data for all its dependencies, but i didnt get all the files together for a full understanding (275 files). I wasnt sure why the build data stopped, so i will explore it some day in the future.
