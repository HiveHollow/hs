&emsp;    I find myself often needing a matrix to properly solve
&emsp;    a math problem or fit things across the monitor, etc.

&emsp;    I call it a "1 4 7 Matrix". Consider an example where
&emsp;    everything runs vertically. I have to write it as so,
&emsp;    to understand it:

&emsp; -- intended position           -- matrix position

&emsp;       1    2    3                   1    4    7
&emsp;     
&emsp;       4    5    6                   2    5    8
&emsp;     
&emsp;       7    8    9                   3    6    9


&emsp;    Part1, Part2 and Part3, in vertical order- map to the first 3 elements
&emsp;    in the row, a horizontal order. And so on...
&emsp;    We want vertically-running Parts, to appear in intended order,
&emsp;    as the vertical ordering wraps back to the top.
&emsp;    And in this example, they wrap back every 3 elements.

&emsp;    In an example such as one that utilizes <a href="dib">DIB</a>, the screen runs
&emsp;    from left to right, often referring to the convention <a href="stride">stride</a>.



&emsp;  RECT Information

&emsp; An application must use a RECT structure to define a rectangle.
&emsp; The structure specifies the coordinates of two points:
&emsp; the upper left and lower right corners of the rectangle.
&emsp; The sides of the rectangle extend from these two points
&emsp; and are parallel to the x-axis and y-axis.

&emsp; The coordinate values for a rectangle are expressed as signed integers.
&emsp; The coordinate value of a rectangle's right side must be greater than
&emsp; that of its left side. Likewise, the coordinate value of the bottom
&emsp;  must be greater than that of the top.

&emsp;  Because applications can use rectangles for many different purposes,
&emsp;  the rectangle functions do not use an explicit unit of measure. Instead,
&emsp;   all rectangle coordinates and dimensions are given in signed, logical values.
&emsp;    The mapping mode and the function in which the rectangle is used determine the units of measure.
