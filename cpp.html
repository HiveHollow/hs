&emsp;&emsp; written in the form of: &emsp; enum{state1,}; &emsp; struct{};
 &emsp;&emsp; This also ties in with Functions(){} In that you can
&emsp;&emsp; Overload by creating functions of the same name, &emsp; and those function
&emsp;&emsp; attributes will inherit from prior functions. Some other things are &emsp;

&emsp;&emsp; <a> &emsp; : </a><a href="main">Main</a><a> &emsp; Main() is the entry point
&emsp;&emsp; of C/C++ application. If you use int main(), &emsp; It will return integer
&emsp;&emsp; value as return. If you use void main(), &emsp; then this will not return
&emsp;&emsp; anything. Note that the software &emsp; over which applications execute, has
&emsp;&emsp; to prepare stack before calling Main(). &emsp; There can be two types of
&emsp;&emsp; applications: &emsp; 1: Bare board based : Which runs directly on hardware.
&emsp;&emsp; For example, &emsp; any boot loader such as u-boot. The CPU starts from a
&emsp;&emsp; reset vector, &emsp; initialize required resources such as RAM, and then
&emsp;&emsp; jump to Main(). &emsp; In this case generally void main() can be used.
&emsp;&emsp; &emsp; 2: Operating System based : If the application is &emsp;&emsp; supposed to run
&emsp;&emsp; on top of &emsp; OS such as Windows,Linux etc. It's the operating system &rsquo;s
&emsp;&emsp; responsibility to &emsp; create necessary stack or other resources before
&emsp;&emsp; calling Main(). &emsp; If an application is supposed to return a value or
&emsp;&emsp; error, then one can use int &emsp; Main(). Generally it will return -1 for
&emsp;&emsp; error, for example if your &emsp; application failed to acquire required
&emsp;&emsp; memory or other resources. &emsp; ... See also - what's called "'Words' in
