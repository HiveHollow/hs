&emsp;&emsp; UTF-8 is an example of character encoding. Encoding itself is a
&emsp;&emsp; reoccuring element in programming. To  encode  or  decode is simple.
&emsp;&emsp; A set of numbers (10010100) is assigned to a character. That allows a file
&emsp;&emsp; to do further arithmetic on the numbers, whether that be in binary or a made up number system.
&emsp;&emsp; Decoding  does just the opposite. It  'decodes'  the character back into a number. There is
&emsp;&emsp; some nuance that would require extra research for getting the best understanding of it.
&emsp;&emsp; Encoding finds its application in file handling cryptography
&emsp;&emsp; and  other cipher related tasks; relative to, are the lossless data compression
&emsp;&emsp; used by many,  ie. Zip files,  PNG...

&emsp;&emsp; And thats where BMP file format  or  <a href="dib">DIB</a> comes into the conversation...
&emsp;&emsp; What even is a  file  format? Its a standard way that information is encoded
&emsp;&emsp; for storage in a computer file. In particular, BMP is a raster graphics image file format.
