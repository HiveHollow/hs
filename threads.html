&emsp; — 09/16/2021: Note -- Threads --

&emsp; A thread does 'hanging' -- concurrent programming; See also ; spawn computing.
&emsp; We'll start off by listing all the terms associated with it:

&emsp; ————— semaphore
&emsp; ————— spinlock
&emsp; ————— atomic
&emsp; ————— mutex
&emsp; ————— volatile


&emsp; A lock (or mutex) is a mechanism that enforces a limitation to a resource,
&emsp; especially when there are many threads of execution.
&emsp; A lock is designed to enforce a mutual exclusion concurrency policy...
&emsp; The simplest type of lock being; a binary semaphore. A semaphore is just
&emsp; an abstract data type in laymans terms. A spinlock, handled in a for-loop,
&emsp; will wait for a lock until it becomes available again.
&emsp; The atomic keyword refers to a cpu property used to manipulate an object
&emsp; without using a mutex lock. The volatile qualifier is used to tell the compiler that
&emsp; the value of said-code may change at any time.
